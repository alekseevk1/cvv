{% blocktrans %}This page allows to adjust settings for unsafe mark in order to meet the user requirements.
Usually this page should be used, if unsafe mark with default settings does not meet the requirements, i.e.
either it is applied to traces, which correspond to other bugs, or there are trace, which correspond to the same bug,
but the mark was not applied to them.{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}Error traces are called <b>equivalent</b> if they correspond to the same bug (or to the same reason of false alarm).
In order to compare error trace under analysis {{t1}} with some other error trace {{t2}} the <code>is_equivalent({{t1}}, {{t2}})</code>
function is suggested:{% endblocktrans %}
<h4 class="ui header center aligned">
    <code>is_equivalent({{t1}}, {{t2}}) ≡ similarity(comparison(manual(conversion({{t1}}, args)), conversion({{t2}}, args))) >= similarity_threshold</code>

{% blocktrans %}In case of one-threaded error trace this function is simplified into:{% endblocktrans %}
<h4 class="ui header center aligned">
    <code>is_equivalent({{t1}}, {{t2}}) ≡ comparison(manual(conversion({{t1}}, args)), conversion({{t2}}, args))</code>
</h4>
{% blocktrans %}Conversion function <code>conversion(t, args)</code> removes nonessential error trace elements,
<code>args</code> are optional parameters.
Comparison function <code>comparison(t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>)</code> determines, how two error traces are compared (as sequences).
If an error trace consists of multiple threads, then it returns the number of equivalent threads.
Function <code>manual(t)</code> corresponds to the user changes in an error trace
(e.g., the user may remove some elements in addition to conversion function).
In case of multi-threaded error trace, function <code>similarity(n)</code> evaluates similarity of 2 error traces based on the number of equivalent threads,
which should be greater or equal to the given <code>similarity_threshold</code> value in order to consider traces to be equivalent.
Therefore, unsafe mark is determined by the following parameters <code>conversion, args, comparison, similarity, similarity_threshold</code>.<br>
Note, that traces are considered to be equivalent with respect to the given parameters. If they are meaningless, this comparison means nothing.{% endblocktrans %}
